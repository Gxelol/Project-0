          I love cats and dogs. They are the cutiest animals that exist. Unfortunately, I'm alergic to their fur. But I still think of adopting three cats and a dog, living with sneezes. Animals are one of the better friends people can have to.

          Every saturday I play soccer and footvolley, and those moments are incredible relaxing for the body. When I'm immersed I don't think about anything but scoring, it's fun and stimulating.

          Gaming with my friends are the best. We laugh, joke and talk about random stuff all night long. Our conversation is about everything but important things, I think that's the reason why we have so much fun.

          I already code for a while, but this year I started being serious with it, I want to make web development a job and do my best for it. Always being excited for learning and trying new things.
